It‚Äôs official, the countdown is on the for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games #GC2018. The Edit Suite have been given a backstage pass in creating a series called ‚ÄúImpact of the Games‚Äù documenting everything from The Gold Coast Schools Connect program, transformations of Community Centres across the Gold Coast, modified vehicles from Thrifty, the design and OPENING of the Athletes Village to the LAST STRAW as GC2018 will be a straw free event. The GC2018 games will be a lasting legacy on the Gold Coast ‚Äì lets have a look on what we discovered along the way.

GC2018 is the biggest event Australia has seen this decade, with more than 1400 staff and 15,000 volunteers ‚Äì The Edit Suite team checked out the GC2018 Merchandise Super Centre in Broadbeach. Preparation is underway with shelves being stocked and making sure that there are plenty of Borobi‚Äôs ready for all!

Filming for the series took place in Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise to highlight Iconic locations around the Gold Coast.

Broadbeach will be a Mecca for the GC2018 games ‚Äì with Festival 2018, the Lawn Bowls plus Netball Preliminaries and the Basketball finals held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre. We were sent to capture some of the initiatives that have been put in place not just for the games but to leave a lasting legacy for the Gold Coast.

Did you know that straws and plastic bags have been banned at from GC2018 games ‚Äì saving our waterways and marine life!

Whilst filming in the Kurrawa park it was quiet tricky getting the vision and audio as the gardeners were busy landscaping the grounds with whipper snippers and lawn mowers! You can definitely feel the excitement growing with builders and council workers updating and constructing facilities in preparation of the games.

Here, Josh our videographer is setting up the shot underneath the Surfers Paradise Archway ‚Äì Jess our fabulous presenter had to time her pieces to camera with the traffic lights to minimise noise.

As the majority of facilities and centres are still under construction for the games ‚Äì The Edit Suite team had to become creative in capturing vision for the series. With The Optus Aquatic Centre being transformed there was no access inside but by filming from the waterways we were able to capture a picturesque view from the water. Plus it was a great excuse to get everyone out on the boat for the day üôÇ

However the day wasn‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows, half way through the day we did run into some trouble, after trying to capture a shot from a sand bank, the boat got stuck and it took a team effort to drag it back into the water!

On day three of filming the team headed out to Gold Coast Turf Club for the interview with Rebecca Sturgeon from GOLDOC! Pulling up to Turf Club ‚Äì the carpark was organised to perfection with the fleet of GC2018 games cars.

Did you know that the colour scheme for GC2018 Games cars were designed to represent the earth!

Welcome to GC2018 Athletes Village!

Wow ‚Äì what a privilege to have a VIP tour of GC2018 Athletes Village before it is open to the Athletes! It was the first day that media was allowed inside ‚Äì the Edit Suite team captured a first look at what Athletes can expect whilst living here on the Gold Coast.

Did you know that GC2018 is the largest integrated para-sport program in Commonwealth Games history ‚Äì the Athletes Village has been designed to ensure accessibility for people with mobility and other impairments.
