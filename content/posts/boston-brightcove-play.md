The Edit Suite’s Creative Director Josh attended Brightcove Play in Boston.

What is Brightcove Play? Well each year, media companies and marketers from around the world convene in Boston for hands-on learning, in-depth strategy sessions, next-generation product demos, all-star keynotes and networking.

But, why? Well Josh is always at the forefront of emerging technologies and Brightcove is a revolutionary digital platform service so Josh travelled 23 hours and 58 mins to learn the latest technology in digital media.

Plus it was a great excuse to see such a beautiful city – Boston is the oldest city in America with incredible architecture, iconic places like Fenway Park home of the Boston Red Sox, the famous bar – Cheers, the classic Reuben sandwich and of course the oldest restaurant in America the Union Oyster  House.

Check out Josh’s pictures from his awesome trip 🙂

## Fenway Park Home of the Boston Red Sox

No one can travel to Boston and not see the Boston Red Sox play at Fenway Park – so much history in one place!

Plus Josh got to see The Green Monster in person (popular nickname for the 11.3 m high left field wall). The Green Monster is famous for preventing home runs on many line drives that would clear the walls of other ballparks #howcrazy

## Royal Rooters Club

This means something completely different in America LOL! The original Royal Rooters was a fan club for the Boston Americans, which in 1908 changed its name to the Boston Red Sox.

## Cheers

This was at the top of Josh’s must do list whilst in Boston! Getting amongst the action in the Boston bar that inspired the TV series “Cheers”! Getting the chance to drink a beer while sitting in the same place where Norm Peterson’s character did was a highlight!

## Union Oyster House

Dining at America’s oldest restaurant. This Boston fixture, housed in a building dating back to pre-revolutionary days, started serving food in 1826 and has continued ever since!

## Pastrami Pastrami Pastrami!

The classic old styled deli sandwich, definitely gives New York a run for their money when it comes to the Reuben!
