The Edit Suiteâ€™s Creative Director Josh attended Brightcove Play in Boston.

What is Brightcove PLAY? Well each year, media companies and marketers from around the world convene in Boston for hands-on learning, in-depth strategy sessions, next-generation product demos, all-star keynotes and networking.

But, why? Well Josh is always at the forefront of emerging technologies and Brightcove is a revolutionary digital platform service so Josh travelled 23 hours and 58 mins to learn the latest technology in digital media.

Plus it was a great excuse to see such a beautiful city â€“ Boston is the oldest city in America with incredible architecture, iconic places like Fenway Park home of the Boston Red Sox, the famous bar â€“ Cheers, the classic Reuben sandwich and of course the oldest restaurant in America the Union Oyster House.
