It was absolutely beautiful to see the sunrise over Brisbane City especially from the eleventh story of a building in Milton Green business precinct. Such a great way to start a three day shoot for Milton Green – capturing a perfect time-lapse for the opening of the video.

Working with Creswick Creative from Melbourne we captured and highlighted the facilities, building spaces, amenities and of course the ideal location of Milton Green, it was an action packed three days #neveradullmoment

It was a fun and exciting shoot with very early starts and lots of coffee – here the behind the scenes pictures we captured.
