Why is video branding so important….Video branding creates a unique emotional connection.

In this digital age, video is a fundamental necessity… it can be powerful when combined with the right narrative and visual cues. This can evoke or instill an emotion in a potential client about your product, service or brand.

Did you know google LOVES videos. Since buying YouTube, Google algorithms heavily favour video content over text-based.

Southport Sharks re-brand video
In 2017 Gold Coast AFL football club, The Southport Sharks decided to rebrand their club, to modernise the brand but also retain some form of their heritage. We provided video production and editing to capture and highlight the creative process in designing the new brand and identity. Speaking with the CEO of Southport Sharks Dean Bowtell this video discusses along with the designer Matt Vergotis the creative steps of the re-brand. We created their main video which was to be featured on their website plus provided a shorter 60 second version for their social media channels.
