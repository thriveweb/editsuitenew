  title: Hobart Adventures!

Another week, another location! Josh our Creative Director was on the road again for his next adventure, straight after returning from Boston! This time to Hobart in Tasmania #neveradullmoment #jetlag

With another incredible location with picturesque views and breathtaking scenery this was a great opportunity for Josh to try out his new blogging toys including the Sony RX 100v camera and DJI Spark drone. After filming finished each day Josh took the opportunity to explore the natural wonders of Hobart – trekking up mountains to get a prime spot to launch the drone and camping out to capture the perfect Hobart sunset.

(PS) this was just for fun – lets call it a passion project for Josh. He always finds the beauty in any place and loves to share what he finds along the way. Check out the pictures Josh captured of the city, hinterland, Hobart’s Constitution Dock, the Tasman Bridge, the old world styled architecture and of course the food!

Also make sure to scroll to the bottom of the page to and click the link – Josh also made a cool video from the drone footage he captured! It’s next level!
