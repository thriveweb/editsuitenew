The Helm Bar has been transformed into the Jamaican Commonwealth Manor for the duration of the GC2018 games.

It was an absolute privilege to be invited along to capture a glimpse of what the Jamaican Manor has in-store for the games.

Here is a behind scenes look on what we captured for the series ‘How to be’.

## Josh, Chef Karl, Louise

Josh and Louise meeting the Head Chef Karl Thomas who was especially flown in from Canada to create authentic Jamaican cuisine for the Manor! We can’t wait to try the Rum and Raisin Cheesecake.

Below are some of the AMAZING Jamaican dishes that will be featured on the menu – like jerk Chicken, jerk pork, oxtail festival, bammies and cornmeal pudding.
