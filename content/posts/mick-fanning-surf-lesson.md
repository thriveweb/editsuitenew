What a stunning morning at Kirra Point, Coolangatta. It was such a privilege to interview three-time world surfing champion Mick Fanning about teaching sporting champions Jessica Gallagher, Anna Meares OAM and Chad le Clos how to surf!

We had a quick chat with Chad Le Clos before they headed out for the lesson â€“ he was really pumped to get pointers from surf legend Mick Fanning.
