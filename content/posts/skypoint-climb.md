Ok, question? Are you okay with heights? â€“ me, yes I should be fine.

Well, that was definitely an understatement when I stepped out onto the first step of the SkyPoint Climb (Australiaâ€™s highest external building climb â€“ rising 270m into the air) â€“ no biggie!

Cheating death was not on my Tuesday afternoon list of â€˜to dosâ€™ but never a dull day at The Edit Suite!

Working with Urban List and SkyPoint â€“ The Edit Suite was engaged to capture and highlight the SkyPoint climb â€“ not just through the day but also at Sunset.

Here are our behind the scenes picture ðŸ™‚ Definitely worth the trip up â€“ the views are INCREDIBLE!
