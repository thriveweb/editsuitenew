Welcome to Festival 2018!

The Edit Suite are working with Gold Coast Commonwealth Games organizers to create social content throughout the games.

It was awesome to be amongst the action in Broadbeach – here are our highlights from the Festival so far!

## Jarjums Learning Space

This was a really fun and exciting space for children – lots of activities including weaving, colouring in, puzzles and artworks.

## Arboria Architects of Air (United Kingdom)

This was AMAZING – when we entered, it felt like you where transported into another world. The walk through sculpture is a journey through a dazzling maze of lights and colours.

P.s make sure you wear matching socks as you have to remove your shoes on entry!

## Weaving Water Stories

What a great way to be part of this installation with your very own words. Weaving water stories is all about the celebration of water – the giver of life!

## Gathering – Directed by Luther Cora (AUS)

For generations, Yugambeh People have given life to this country – histories have been retold, stories have been shared and lessons have been passed down. This was absolutely incredible performance, highly recommend heading down to see this in Kurrawa park.
